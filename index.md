This book is an introduction to programming language theory, written
in Agda.  The authors are [Wen Kokke][wen] and [Philip Wadler][phil].

Please send us comments!  The text is currrently being drafted.  Part I
is ready for comment. We plan that Part II will be ready for comment
by the end of May.

Comments on all matters---organisation, material we should add,
material we should remove, parts that require better explanation, good
exercises, errors, and typos---are welcome.  Pull requests for small
fixes are encouraged.
